##Project Description
This is a customer facing website for a fictional, artisanal soap company.  The pages are designed to be responsive for viewing on a variety of screens.   This project started as part of classwork at Harvard Extension, Fundamentals of Website Design and has been expanded since the course ended.

##Features
* Each of the product preview boxes will show an expanded view using the Fancybox JQuery plugin
* The ‘Add to Cart’ buttons forward the quantity to and echo script on Harvards Morpheus server which will return the variables sent
* The ‘Request a Quote’ page utilizes the same script to echo the form data
* ’Contact Us’ and ‘Your account’ are dead links at this time

##ToDo
~~ * Make favicon link relative ~~
* Fix broken links from Morpheus move (make all links relative)
* Change main background image to something that makes text more readable
* Create a proper ‘Contact Us’ page
* Research shopping cart plugins
